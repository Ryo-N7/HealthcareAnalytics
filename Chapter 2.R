# Designing Meta-data:
# Data dictionary: Document clearly what variables mean + what levels of categorical variables mean
# Use Excel!
# Documentation = Curation
# Native variables vs. calculated variables

# Exposure: Something theorized/hypothesized to cause/protect from/associated with a disease or certain outcome
# Confounding variables: variable associated with outcome but NOT on causal pathway between exposure and outcome
# Outcome: Seomthing theorized/hypothesized is affected by the exposure.

# Webs of Causation: Visualization of Exposure + Confounder + Outcome network.
